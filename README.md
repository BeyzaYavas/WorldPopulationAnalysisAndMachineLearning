A DATA ANALYSIS ON WORLD POPULATION WITH THE HELP OF MACHINE LEARNING WITH PYTHON

The world population changes over time due to various reasons such as death, birth and migration. The fact that the population has a variable structure causes demographic and geographical features to be affected by these changes. It is possible to analyze how these changes affect geographical and demographic characteristics by using data based on years. In this study, it is aimed to examine the population change by performing data analysis and machine learning. First of all, the data set was cleaned and made suitable for analysis. Afterwards, some results were obtained by analyzing the data set. In the application part, a population estimation model was created with linear regression from machine learning methods. The accuracy of this model has been tested with the real dataset. Different metrics were used for the test result. When the metrics are examined, it can be seen that the model does not produce good results. If the relationships between the variables are increased by using more population data, it can be ensured that the model produces better results.
